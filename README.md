### Not So Many Fish

You are going to write an application that simulates a dating service. It does not take any input.  Read through the entire assignment and PLAN your solution before you code it! 

You will start with a pre-set list of people (make 6 of them, 3 male, 3 female). 

You are going to select 2 people at random from a list and match them up. If a person gets matched up with him/herself, they are free on Saturday night. 

Do this for 10 interations, numbering the interactions by the DATES (see below).

At the end of the interaction, you should be able to list: 
The people who went out on dates, and who they went out with. How many dates did each person go on?

Done already? 
Add additional scenarios that you can keep track of - for example "Jack tipped over a glass during a date with Mary". They should also be randomly generated, and should be a list.

This is an example of your output: 

1 Lisa asked Sarah out, and Sarah accepted
* Lisa played chess with Sarah
* Lisa visited Sarah
* Lisa went to dinner with Sarah

2 Simon asked Lisa out, and Lisa accepted
* Simon tipped over a glass during a date with Lisa
* Simon saw a movie with Lisa
* Simon played chess with Lisa

3 Simon asked Lisa out, and Lisa accepted
* Simon went to dinner with Lisa
* Simon saw a movie with Lisa
* Simon went to a meetup with Lisa

4 Simon asked Lisa out, and Lisa accepted
* Simon tipped over a glass during a date with Lisa
* Simon went to a meetup with Lisa
* Simon went to dinner with Lisa

5 Michael asked Simon out, and Simon accepted
* Michael saw a movie with Simon
* Michael went to dinner with Simon
* Michael tipped over a glass during a date with Simon

6 Sarah asked Michael out, and Michael accepted
* Sarah saw a movie with Michael
* Sarah played chess with Michael
* Sarah went to a meetup with Michael
* Simon is free Saturday night
* Sarah is free Saturday night

7 Simon asked Sarah out, and Sarah accepted
* Simon saw a movie with Sarah
* Simon visited Sarah
* Simon played chess with Sarah
* Simon is free Saturday night

Done with this? **Bonus!** 

When people break up, they can never be paired up again.
